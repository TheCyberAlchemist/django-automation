This project is the automation of my Django deployment workflow.

# üóíÔ∏è Steps to Get Started

# ‚ú® Workflow Automated 
- Askes weather to pull from the remote repo.
  - If "Yes"
    - Prompts for the github username and token.
    - Stashes the current changes (If any).
    - Pulls from the github URL (set in **config.sh**).
- Checks weather ***Debug*** is set to False.
  - Asks to change it to False Automatically.
- Prints the ***Allowed_Hosts*** array for ready reference.
- Runs **manage.py collectstatic** command.
- Installs all the pip packages form requirements.txt (if found).
- Runs ***manage.py runserver*** on the given server URL (set in **config.sh**).

# ‚ùî Variables in config.sh
- ***project_dir*** -- The is the absolute path to the Django Project Directory. (Usually starts like "~/...")

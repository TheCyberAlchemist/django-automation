This project is the automation of my Django deployment workflow.

# üóíÔ∏è Steps to Get Started
- Clone this repository into your server.
- Change the required config.sh variables. ( Detailed explanation [here üîó](https://github.com/TheCyberAlchemist/django-automation#-variables-in-configsh))
- Go to the Django Project Directory.
- Execute *master.sh*.
- Answer the prompts.
- ‚ò∫Ô∏è Relax.

# ‚ú® Workflow Automated 
- Asks whether to pull from the remote repo.
  - If "Yes"
    - Prompts for the GitHub username and token.
    - Stashes the current changes (If any).
    - Pulls from the GitHub URL (set in **config.sh**).
- Checks whether ***Debug*** is set to False.
  - Asks to change it to False Automatically.
- Prints the ***Allowed_Hosts*** array for ready reference.
- Runs **manage.py collectstatic** command.
- Installs all the pip packages from requirements.txt (if found).
- Runs ***manage.py runserver*** on the given server URL (set in **config.sh**).

# ‚ùî Variables in config.sh
- ***project_dir*** -- This is the absolute path to the Django Project Directory. (Usually starts like "~/...")
- ***project_name*** -- This is the name of the Django Project. (i.e. The Folder name where the settings.py is stored) 
- ***git_url*** -- This is the GitHub repo and branch URL. (‚ÄºÔ∏è Please note that there must be no "https://" in this string ‚ÄºÔ∏è)
- ***python_command*** -- This is nothing but the "python" command used by the system. (Usually "python3" in Linux systems)
- ***pip_command*** -- Pip command used by the system. (Usually "pip3" in Linux systems)
- ***server_url*** -- The URL on which the Django Server should be hosted. (Usually 0:80 in the production server).
- The rest of the variables are not to be changed.

# üóíÔ∏è Future Goals
- Add the server URL automatically into the allowed hosts.
- Making the scripts play well with relative paths.
